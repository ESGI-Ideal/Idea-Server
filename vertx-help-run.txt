       main-verticle

Runs a verticle called <main-verticle> in its own instance of vert.x.

Options and Arguments:
 -cp,--classpath <classpath>                 Provides an extra classpath to be
                                             used for the verticle deployment.
    --cluster                                If specified then the vert.x
                                             instance will form a cluster with
                                             any other vert.x instances on the
                                             network.
    --cluster-host <host>                    host to bind to for cluster
                                             communication. If this is not
                                             specified vert.x will attempt to
                                             choose one from the available
                                             interfaces.
    --cluster-port <port>                    Port to use for cluster
                                             communication. Default is 0 which
                                             means choose a spare random port.
    --conf <config>                          Specifies configuration that should
                                             be provided to the verticle.
                                             <config> should reference either a
                                             text file containing a valid JSON
                                             object which represents the
                                             configuration OR be a JSON string.
    --ha                                     If specified the verticle will be
                                             deployed as a high availability
                                             (HA) deployment. This means it can
                                             fail over to any other nodes in the
                                             cluster started with the same HA
                                             group.
    --hagroup <group>                        used in conjunction with -ha this
                                             specifies the HA group this node
                                             will join. There can be multiple HA
                                             groups in a cluster. Nodes will
                                             only failover to other nodes in the
                                             same group. Defaults to
                                             '__DEFAULT__'.
    --instances <instances>                  Specifies how many instances of the
                                             verticle will be deployed. Defaults
                                             to 1.
    --on-redeploy <cmd>                      Optional shell command executed
                                             when a redeployment is triggered
    --quorum <q>                             Used in conjunction with -ha this
                                             specifies the minimum number of
                                             nodes in the cluster for any HA
                                             deploymentIDs to be active.
                                             Defaults to 1.
    --redeploy <includes>                    Enable automatic redeployment of
                                             the application. This option takes
                                             a set on includes as parameter
                                             indicating which files need to be
                                             watched. Patterns are separated by
                                             a comma.
    --redeploy-grace-period <period>         When redeploy is enabled, this
                                             option configures the grace period
                                             between 2 redeployments. The time
                                             is given in milliseconds. 1000 ms
                                             by default.
    --redeploy-scan-period <period>          When redeploy is enabled, this
                                             option configures the file system
                                             scanning period to detect file
                                             changes. The time is given in
                                             milliseconds. 250 ms by default.
    --redeploy-termination-period <period>   When redeploy is enabled, this
                                             option configures the time waited
                                             to be sure that the previous
                                             version of the application has been
                                             stopped. It is useful on Windows,
                                             where the 'terminate' command may
                                             take time to be executed.The time
                                             is given in milliseconds. 0 ms by
                                             default.
    --worker                                 If specified then the verticle is a
                                             worker verticle.
 <main-verticle>                             The main verticle to deploy, it can
                                             be a fully qualified class name or
                                             a file.
